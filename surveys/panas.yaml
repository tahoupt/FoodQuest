    from Watson 1988: 
    
    We have used PANAS with the following time instructions:

    Moment (you feel this way right now, that is,at the present moment) 
    Today (you have felt this way today)
    Past few days (you have felt this way during the past few days)
    Week (you have felt this way during the past week)
    Past few weeks  (you have felt this way during the past few weeks)
    Year (you have felt this way during the past year)
    General (you generally feel this way,that is, how you feel on the average)
