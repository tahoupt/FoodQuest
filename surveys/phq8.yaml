label: "PHQ-8"

title: "Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8)"

identifier: phq8

instructions: "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?"
    
comment: |
     This is an adaptation of the PHQ-9 scale. Since this scale is self-administered in our studies, question #9, "How often during the past 2 weeks were you bothered by thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way?", was deleted.

scoring: |
    If two consecutive numbers are circled, score the higher (more distress) number. If the numbers are not consecutive, do not score the item. Score is the sum of the 8 items. If more than 1 item missing, set the value of the scale to missing. A score of 10 or greater is considered major depression, 20 or more is severe major depression.
